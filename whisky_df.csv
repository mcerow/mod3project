","Talisker was 007's drink of choice, not the martini--shaken or not.

An interesting component of these stills is the swan-neck lye pipes that force some of the alcohol to be condensed before they hit the worm tubs and is redistilled. This gives Talisker its rich body!

These flat tops help increase reflux, and in the end give this whisky a complex character more-so than most other Speyside distilleries.

This release of their single malt whiskey, Lot 14, is a lollapalooza of sensations. The barrel list alone should clue you in to the fact that you're in for quite a ride: ex-bourbon, ex-Tennessee, French and American oak sherry & port, St. George apple brandy, and Blacksmith Cellars white wine barrels. A blend of 100% barley whiskeys aged anywhere from 4 to 15 years, this is a single malt that follows no orthodoxy. And it's delicious.
",NAS,43.0,"Made in the USA from 100% malted barley. Distilled at one distillery. Matured in oak casks no larger than 700L. Distilled to no higher than 160 proof (80% ABV). Bottled at 80 proof (40% ABV) or higher. (This is the proposed Standard of Identity by the American Single Malt Whiskey Commission.)

","Variety of American & French oak used from ex-bourbon, ex-port, ex-sherry, ex-apple brandy, ex-white wine","""On the nose, you’ll find heavy cocoa, ripe mango, Gala apple, almonds and Nutella. The palate reveals a load of bready grain and honeysuckle under a prominent cocoa flavor. Overall, the whiskey is a lot of fun; it begins mildly, ripens to a viscous, malty crescendo that explodes in the middle, and then dries out for a lengthy finish. For extra credit, pair with a light lager for an interesting combination of light and bold flavors.

Single barrel whiskeys are unique bottlings so your mileage may vary, but you'll generally be sipping a rye-drinker's bourbon.

Attempts to contact the distillery on the telephone were met with failure, and neither a website nor email address can be found.

","From the Whyte & MacKay Blenders in Glasgow, this whisky is the brainchild of Vijay Mallya, a noted Scotch collector.

The bottles were accidentally left on Antarctica by a British expedition led by Ernest Shackleton, and preserved at below-freezing temperatures for almost a century before being recovered. Paterson, the master blender at W & M, determined that the whisky was most likely from the now-demolished Glen Mhor Distillery (whose stocks are now housed at the Dalmore Distillery), smoked with peat from the Orkney Islands, and aged in ex-bourbon and ex-sherry casks. In order to recreate the flavors of the Scotch, he sourced whiskies from Glenfarclas, Mannochmore, Tamnavulin, Glenrothes, Old Pulteney, Ben Nevis and the Isle of Jura.

Luckily the taste matches the nose immediately, with a very smooth approach, before going towards more burnt caramel and even a little tar.

This is a lovely blended scotch that would have gained in style from being a touch less dry, if I may say.""",30,30,50,20,20,50,70,50,10,10,40,50,70,20

Prichard's // Tennessee, USA
","Prichard’s employs two historical family insights, the first led Prichard to use a smaller, more select portion of each distillation run, which allows him to bottle his whiskeys with less added water —less dilution results in a more flavorful whiskey. The second family secret involves mellowing the whiskey while it's still in the barrels. Most Tennessee whiskey distillers rely on charcoal filtering to soften and mellow their whiskeys. Again following the example set by his great grandfather, Prichard accomplishes this crucial step by maturing his whiskeys in new oak casks with deep, 3-millimeter ""alligator"" char. The whiskey is distilled primarily from sweet white corn with lesser amounts of rye and malted barley in pot stills. It is aged for 10 years in both new, charred American oak barrels and 15-gallon rum casks before being reduced to 80 proof with limestone-filtered spring water and bottled intact, and unfiltered.
